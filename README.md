# Overview

As a software engineer, my goal is to continuously enhance my skills and knowledge. This project focuses on leveraging the Pandas library for data analysis tasks. By working with real-world data from the MLB (Major League Baseball), I aim to further my understanding of data manipulation, aggregation, and visualization using Pandas.

## Dataset Description

The dataset consists of two CSV files: `batting.csv` and `master.csv`. The `batting.csv` file contains batting statistics from the 2012 MLB season, including player performance metrics such as runs, hits, home runs, stolen bases, and more. On the other hand, the `master.csv` file provides information about all MLB players, including their birth year, full name, physical attributes, and handedness for batting and throwing.

The full datasets can be found here [Baseball Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/open-source-sports/baseball-databank?resource=download)
I cut my data sets down to a more manageable data set. 

## Purpose

The purpose of this software is to perform various data analysis tasks on the provided dataset using Pandas. The code will address several questions related to player performance and team batting averages. By analyzing the data, we aim to extract meaningful insights and identify top performers in specific categories such as home runs, stolen bases, RBI (Runs Batted In), and team batting averages.

The software will load and merge the dataset files, perform aggregations based on player and team, and present the results in a readable format. Additionally, the overall batting averages of the top 5 teams will be visualized through a bar graph to facilitate easy interpretation.

# Data Analysis Results

1. What 3 players lead the season in home runs?
2. What 3 players had the most stolen bases?
3. What 3 players had the most RBI's?
4. What 5 teams had the highest overall batting averages?
